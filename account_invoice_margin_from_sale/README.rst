==================================
Customer Invoice Margins from Sale
==================================

* A bridge module for sale_margin and account_invoice_margin
* If a purchase price has been set for a sale order line, it gets
  transferred to the invoice line as a default suggestion
* Note that the sale and invoice line purchase prices are not kept in sync, so
  changing one will not automatically affect the other.
